# Pexip Infinity on Google Cloud Platform

Infrastructure as Code template for deploying Pexip Infinity video conferencing platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This template will deploy the Pexip infrastructure, but still requires configuration after deployment.

## Overview

This repository provides Terraform templates for deploying and managing Pexip Infinity video conferencing infrastructure on GCP. The templates are designed to provide a flexible, easy-to-use experience for deploying and managing Pexip Infinity on GCP.

### Features

- Multi-region transcoding node support by use of "pool" concept
- Optional proxy node deployment also by use of "pool" concept
- Customizable instance configurations
- Flexible image management:
  - Use existing images from your GCP bucket
  - Automatically upload and create images from local files

## Prerequisites

### Required for Deployment
1. Terraform >= 1.0.0
2. GCP Project with:
   - Required APIs enabled. This module will attempt to enable them.
   - Service Account with necessary permissions
3. VPC Network and subnets already created
4. Pexip Infinity Management and Conference node images. These can be downloaded from https://www.pexip.com/help-center/platform-download
   - Option 1: Images already uploaded to a GCP bucket
   - Option 2: Local image files that the template will upload to a new or existing bucket

### Optional Development Tools
If you plan to contribute to this project, we use the following tools to maintain code quality:
- Pre-commit hooks for code formatting and validation
- TFLint for Terraform linting
- terraform-docs for documentation generation

See the Development Setup section for installation instructions.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Josh-E-S/pexip-infinity-gcp-terraform.git
cd pexip-infinity-gcp-terraform
```

2. Copy and modify the example variables file:
```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

3. Configure your deployment in terraform.tfvars:
   - Set your GCP project ID and network name
   - Configure regions and zones
   - Set image configuration:
     ```hcl
     pexip_images = {
       management = {
         # Option 1: Use existing GCP image
         name = "existing-management-image"
         # OR Option 2: Specify local file to upload
         source_file = "/path/to/pexip-infinity-management-node.qcow2"
       }
       conference = {
         # Similar options for conference node image
       }
     }
     ```
   - Configure node pools and services

4. Initialize and apply:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Configuration

### Required Variables

- `project_id`: Your GCP project ID
- `network_name`: Name of your VPC network
- `pexip_images`: Configuration for Pexip Infinity images
- `management_node`: Management node configuration
- `transcoding_node_pools`: Transcoding node pool configurations

See `terraform.tfvars.example` for a complete list of variables and their descriptions.

## Development Setup

This section is only needed if you plan to contribute to this project. It's not required for deploying Pexip Infinity.

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and consistency. The following hooks are configured:

#### Standard Hooks
- `check-merge-conflict`: Checks for merge conflict strings
- `detect-private-key`: Checks for presence of private keys
- `check-yaml`: Validates YAML files
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with a newline
- `trailing-whitespace`: Trims trailing whitespace

#### Terraform-specific Hooks
- `terraform_fmt`: Automatically formats Terraform code
- `terraform_docs`: Updates Terraform documentation
- `terraform_tflint`: Runs TFLint for additional Terraform checks

To set up pre-commit:

1. Install pre-commit:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the git hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. (Optional) Run against all files:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

The hooks will run automatically on each commit, ensuring code quality standards are maintained.

## Security

This deployment follows GCP security best practices:
- Least privilege access
- SSH key-based authentication
- Firewall rules for service access control
- Secret management for sensitive data
